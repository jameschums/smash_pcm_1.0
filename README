  About SMASH
  -----------
  Scalable Molecular Analysis Solver for High-performance computing systems
  (SMASH) is open-source software for massively parallel quantum
  chemistry calculations. It is currently capable of energy, analytical
  gradient, and geometry optimization calculations of Hartree-Fock
  theory, Density Functional Theory (DFT), and Second-order 
  Moller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory. DFT calculations can be 
  performed on 100,000 CPU cores of K Computer with high parallel efficiency.
  The Fortran 90/95 language is used with MPI and OpenMP for
  inter-node and intra-node parallelization, respectively. Supported
  platforms are x86-64/Linux with Intel or GNU compilers, and K Computer
  and FX10 with Fujitsu compiler. SMASH is developed and distributed
  under the Apache License 2.0.
